# tumblrscraper
Download all of the images from a given tumblr blog in chronological order.

USAGE:

   `./scrape.pl blogname`
   
   e.g. To scrape foobar.tumblr.com, run `./scrape.pl foobar`

A `foobar` directory will be created and the content downloaded to there.

Note: `tumblrscrape.pl` is deprecated - it should still work, but it downloads one image at a time so will take longer.
